The discussion should focus on the aspects of the disease that would be covered by the proposed indication for the medicinal product. Societal or public health implications of the disease (e.g., impact of poor prevention and control of an infectious disease) should also be addressed where relevant. 2.5.6.1.2 Current Therapies This section provides a description of the major therapies in the intended population (i.e., those therapies used most frequently and/or recommended in clinical guidelines) and the medical need for a new therapy in terms of efficacy, safety, tolerability, convenience, or preference, if applicable.

Benefits are the favorable effects of the medicinal product. In some cases, a benefit may be described by a combination of study endpoints (e.g., the benefit of improved asthma control described by the frequency of exacerbations and hospitalizations and the number of asthma-related deaths). If a surrogate endpoint(s) is the basis of the benefit assessment, the ability of the surrogate to predict clinical benefit and the basis for this expectation should be explained. Benefits may also include important characteristics of the medicinal product, such as convenience (e.g., a more convenient dosing regimen or route of administration) that may lead to improved patient compliance, or benefits that affect those other than the patient (e.g., population benefits of a vaccine due to herd immunity). When identifying the key benefits of the medicinal product, the following characteristics should be considered: \u2022 Clinical importance of the benefit (e.g., life-prolonging, curative, disease-modifying, symptomatic relief, improved patient compliance, functional or quality of life improvement, prevention of disease progression, prevention of infectious disease, diagnostic). \u2022 Magnitude of the absolute difference in frequency of the effect in the study population versus the comparator(s); in some cases, also expressing the difference relative to the comparator may be informative (e.g., if the response rate is 20% in the drug group and 8% in the control group, the absolute difference is 12% (i.e., 20% minus 8%) and the relative effect is 2.5 (i.e., 20% minus 8%)).

The benefit-risk assessment is based on a weighing of the key benefits and key risks of the medicinal product. Key benefits are favorable effects generally assessed by primary and other clinically important endpoints across the studies in a development program; key risks are unfavorable effects that are important from a clinical and/or public health perspective in terms of their frequency and/or severity. The identification of the key benefits and key risks of a product requires a critical evaluation of the entirety of the efficacy and safety information regarding the medicinal product. Not all benefits and risks will necessarily be considered key benefits and key risks. Subsequent benefit-risk assessments of approved products are the subject of the ICH E2C(R2) (Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report: PBRER) guidance, which similarly uses the concepts of key benefits and key risks.\n            ###############################################\n\n            Your task is to analyse the given detailed information, and **all the possible subparts** that needs to be present in the Section 2.5.6.\n            At first provide all the steps and information that needs to be present in each sub-part.

Example 1: Immunogenicity For protein products and other products to which specific immunological reactions have been measured, data regarding immunogenicity should be summarized in this section. For vaccines or other products intended to induce specific immune reactions, immunogenicity data should be described in the efficacy section, 2.7.3. Assays used should briefly be described briefly and information about their performance (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, reliability, validity) should be summarized; the location of detailed information in the application should be cross-referenced. Data regarding the incidence, titre, timing of onset, and duration of antibody responses should be summarized for each type of antibody assay used (e.g., IgG (Immunoglobulin G) by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), neutralization). Relationships of antibody formation to underlying disease, concomitant medication, dose, duration, regimen, and formulation should be explored and summarized. For drugs intended to be given as chronic, continuous therapy, any data on the impact of interruptions of therapy on antigenicity should be analyzed and summarized. It is particularly important to summarize analyses of potential clinically relevant correlates of immunogenicity (e.g., to determine the extent to which the presence of antibodies of a particular type or titer appears to correlate with alterations of pharmacokinetics, changes in pharmacodynamics, loss of efficacy, loss of adverse event profile, or development of adverse events). Particular attention should be paid to events that might be immunologically mediated (e.g., serum sickness) and events that might result from binding of cross-reactive endogenous substances by antibodies to the administered drug. Example 2: Clinical microbiology For antimicrobial or antiviral medicinal products, in vitro studies to characterize the spectrum of activity are an important part of the program of studies relevant to clinical efficacy. Clinical efficacy studies that include characterization of the susceptibility of the clinical isolates as a part of the efficacy determination should be included in section 2.7.3, Summary of Clinical Efficacy. However, studies that evaluate such findings as the pattern of in vitro susceptibility of strains of bacteria from different parts of the world (not in the context of clinical efficacy study) would be included here.\n            ###############################################\n\n            Your task is to analyse the given detailed information, and **all the possible subparts** that needs to be present in the Section 2.7.2.4.\n            At first provide all the steps and information that needs to be present in each sub-part.

This summary should include analyses of all data, irrespective of their support for the overall conclusion and should, therefore, discuss the extent to which the results of the relevant studies do or do not reinforce each other. Any major inconsistencies in the data regarding efficacy should be addressed, and any areas needing further exploration should be identified. The section will generally use two kinds of analyses: comparison of results of individual studies and analysis of data combined from various studies. Details of analyses that are too extensive to be reported in a summary document should be presented in a separate report to be placed in Module 5, section 5.3.5.3. This section should also cross-reference important evidence from section 2.7.2, such as data that support the dosage and administration section of the labeling. These data include dosage and dose interval recommended, evidence pertinent to individualization of dosage and need for modifications of dosage for specific subgroups (e.g., pediatric or geriatric subjects, subjects with hepatic or renal impairment), and data relevant to dose-response or concentration response (PK/PD) relationships. 2.7.3.3.1 Study Populations The demographic and other baseline characteristics of patients across all efficacy studies should be described. The following information should be included: \u2022 The characteristics of the disease (e.g., severity, duration), prior treatment in the study subjects, and study inclusion/exclusion criteria. \u2022 Differences in baseline characteristics of the study populations in different studies or groups of studies. \u2022 Any differences between populations included in critical efficacy analyses and the overall patient population that would be expected to receive the drug when it is marketed should be noted. \u2022 Assessment of the number of patients who dropped out of the studies, time of withdrawal (a defined study day or visit during treatment or follow up period), and reasons for discontinuation. Tabular presentations that combine and compare study populations across studies may be useful.    2.7.3.3.3 Comparison of Results in Subpopulations The results of individual studies or overview analyses of efficacy in specific populations should be summarized in this section. The purpose of these comparisons should be to show whether the claimed treatment effects are observed consistently across all relevant subpopulations, especially those where there are special reasons for concern. The comparisons may highlight apparent variations in efficacy that require further investigation and discussion. The limitations of such analyses, however, should be recognized (ICH E9), and it is important to note that their purpose is not to provide the basis for specific claims or to attempt to improve the evidence of efficacy in situations where the overall results are disappointing. Given the limited sample sizes in individual studies, analyses across multiple studies should be performed to evaluate effects of major demographic factors (age, sex, and race) and of other predefined or relevant intrinsic and extrinsic factors (e.g., disease severity, prior treatment, concomitant illness, concomitant drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and body weight) on efficacy. Factors of special interest may arise from general concerns (e.g., the elderly) or from specific issues that are related to the pharmacology of the drug or that have arisen during earlier drug development. Efficacy in the pediatric population should be routinely analyzed in applications for a proposed indication that occurs in children.

For this analysis, it may be helpful to combine the event severity categories and the causality categories, if they are used, leading to a simpler side-by-side comparison of treatment groups. It should be noted that while causality categories may be reported if used, the presentation of the data should include total adverse events that occurred (whether deemed related or unrelated to treatment); evaluations of causality are inherently subjective and may exclude unexpected adverse events that are in fact treatment related. Additionally, comparisons of rates of adverse events between treatment and control groups in individual trials should be summarized here. It is often useful to tabulate rates in selected trials (see example table 2.7.4.4, in section 2.7.4.7 Appendix).

In that case, no further analysis of these particular factors is needed. Furthermore, it is not necessary that all such analyses be presented in this report.

As a result, consideration of related events as a group, including less important events of potentially related pathophysiology, may be of critical value in understanding the safety profile. For example, the relationship to treatment of an isolated sudden death may become much clearer when considered in the context of cases of syncope, palpitations, and asymptomatic arrhythmias.

Examples include cultured human colonic cells that are used to assess permeability through biological membranes and transport processes and human albumin that is used to assess plasma protein binding. Of particular importance is the use of human biomaterials such as hepatocytes and/or hepatic microsomes to study metabolic pathways and to assess drug-drug interactions with these pathways.

These assessments should provide a description of the body\u2019s handling of a drug over time, focusing on maximum plasma concentrations (peak exposure), area-under-curve (total exposure), clearance, and accumulation of the parent drug and its metabolites, in particular those that have pharmacological activity. The PK studies whose reports should be included in sections 5.3.3.1 and 5.3.3.2 are generally designed to (1) measure plasma drug and metabolite concentrations over time, (2) measure drug and metabolite concentrations in urine or feces when useful or critical, and/or (3) measure drug and metabolite binding to protein or red blood cells. On occasion, PK studies may include measurement of drug distribution into other body tissues, body organs, or fluids (e.g., synovial fluid or cerebrospinal fluid), and the results of these tissue distribution studies should be included in section 5.3.3.1 or 5.3.3.2, as appropriate. These studies should characterize the drug\u2019s PK and provide information about the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of a drug and any active metabolites in healthy subjects and/or patients. Studies of mass balance and changes in PK related to dose (e.g., determination of dose proportionality) or time (e.g., due to enzyme induction or formation of antibodies) are of particular interest and should be included in sections 5.3.3.1 and/or 5.3.3.2. Apart from describing mean PK in normal and patient volunteers, PK studies should also describe the range of individual variability. In the ICH guidance for industry E5 Ethnic Factors in the Acceptance of Foreign Data, factors that may result in different responses to a drug in different populations are categorized as intrinsic ethnic factors or extrinsic ethnic factors. In this document, these categories are referred to as intrinsic factors and extrinsic factors, respectively. Additional studies can also assess differences in systemic exposure as a result of changes in pharmacokinetics due to intrinsic (e.g., age, gender, racial, weight, height, disease, genetic polymorphism, and organ dysfunction) and extrinsic (e.g., drug-interactions, diet, smoking, and alcohol use) factors. Reports of PK studies examining the influence of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on exposure should be organized in sections 5.3.3.3 and 5.3.3.4, respectively. In addition to standard multiple-sample PK studies, population PK analyses based on sparse sampling during clinical studies can also address questions about the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors to the variability in the dose-PK-response relationship. Because the methods used in these studies are substantially different from those used in standard PK studies, population PK studies should be placed in section 5.3.3.5. 5.3.3.1 Healthy Subject PK and Initial Tolerability Study Reports Reports of PK and initial tolerability studies in healthy subjects should be placed in this section. 5.3.3.2 Patient PK and Initial Tolerability Study Reports Reports of PK and initial tolerability studies in patients should be placed in this section. 5.3.3.3 Intrinsic Factor PK Study Reports Reports of PK studies to assess effects of intrinsic factors should be placed in this section. 5.3.3.4 Extrinsic Factor PK Study Reports Reports of PK studies to assess effects of extrinsic factors should be placed in this section. 5.3.3.5 Population PK Study Reports Reports of population PK studies based on sparse samples obtained in clinical trials including efficacy and safety trials should be placed in this section.\n            ###############################################\n\n            Your task is to analyse the given detailed information, and **all the possible subparts** that needs to be present in the Section 5.3.3.\n            At first provide all the steps and information that needs to be present in each sub-part.

Reports of studies whose primary objective is to establish efficacy or to accumulate safety data, however, should be placed in section 5.3.5. This section should include reports of (1) studies of pharmacologic properties known or thought to be related to the desired clinical effects (biomarkers), (2) short-term studies of the main clinical effect, and (3) PD studies of other properties not related to the desired clinical effect. Because a quantitative relationship of these pharmacological effects to dose and/or plasma drug and metabolite concentrations is usually of interest, PD information is frequently collected in dose-response studies or together with drug concentration information in PK studies (concentration-response or PK/PD studies). Relationships between PK and PD effects that are not obtained in well-controlled studies are often evaluated using an appropriate model and used as a basis for designing further dose-response studies or, in some cases, for interpreting effects of concentration differences in population subsets. Dose-finding, PD, and/or PK-PD studies can be conducted in healthy subjects and/or patients and can also be incorporated into the studies that evaluate safety and efficacy in a clinical indication. Reports of dose-finding, PD, and/or PK/PD studies conducted in healthy subjects should be placed in section 5.3.4.1, and the reports for those studies conducted in patients should be placed in section 5.3.4.2. In some cases, the short-term PD, dose-finding, and/or PK-PD information found in PD studies conducted in patients will provide data that contribute to assessment of efficacy, because they show an effect either on an acceptable surrogate marker (e.g., blood pressure) or on a clinical benefit endpoint (e.g., pain relief). Similarly, a PD study may contain important clinical safety information. When these studies are part of the efficacy or safety demonstration, they are considered clinical efficacy and safety studies that should be included in section 5.3.5, not in section 5.3.4. 5.3.4.1 Healthy Subject PD and PK/PD Study Reports PD and/or PK/PD studies having nontherapeutic objectives in healthy subjects should be placed in this section. 5.3.4.2 Patient PD and PK/PD Study Reports PD and/or PK/PD studies in patients should be submitted in this section.\n            ###############################################\n\n            Your task is to analyse the given detailed information, and **all the possible subparts** that needs to be present in the Section 5.3.4.\n            At first provide all the steps and information that needs to be present in each sub-part.

The study reports should provide the level of detail appropriate to the study and its role in the application. ICH E3 describes the contents of a full report for a study contributing evidence pertinent to both safety and efficacy. Abbreviated reports can be provided for some studies (see ICH E3 and individual guidance by region). Within section 5.3.5, studies should be organized by design (controlled, uncontrolled) and, within controlled studies, by type of control. Within each section, studies should be categorized further, ordered by whether the study report is complete or abbreviated (ICH E3), with completely reported studies presented first. Published reports with limited or no further data available to the sponsor should be placed last in this section. In cases where the application includes multiple therapeutic indications, the reports should be organized in a separate section 5.3.5 for each indication. In such cases, if a clinical efficacy study is relevant to only one of the indications included in the application, the study should be included in the appropriate section 5.3.5; if a clinical efficacy study is relevant to multiple indications, the study report should be included in the most appropriate section 5 and referenced as necessary in other sections 5.3.5 (e.g., section 5.3.5A, section 5.3.5B). 5.3.5.1 Study Reports of Controlled Clinical Studies Pertinent to the Claimed Indication The controlled clinical study reports should be sequenced by type of control: \u2022 Placebo control (could include other control groups, such as an active\\comparator or other doses) \u2022 No-treatment control \u2022 Dose-response (without placebo) \u2022 Active control (without placebo) \u2022 External (historical) control, regardless of the control treatment Within each control type, where relevant to assessment of drug effect, studies should be organized by treatment duration. Studies of indications other than the one proposed in the application, but that provide support for efficacy in the proposed use, should be included in section 5.3.5.1. Where a pharmacodynamic study contributes to evidence of efficacy, it should be included in section 5.3.5.1. The sequence in which studies were conducted is not considered pertinent to their presentation. Thus, placebo-controlled trials, whether early or late, should be placed in section 5.3.5.1. Controlled safety studies, including studies in conditions that are not the subject of the application, should also be reported in section 5.3.5.1. 5.3.5.2 Study Reports of Uncontrolled Clinical Studies Study reports of uncontrolled clinical studies (e.g., reports of open label safety studies) should be included in section 5.3.5.2. This includes studies in conditions that are not the subject of the marketing application. 5.3.5.3 Reports of Analyses of Data from More than One Study (Including Any Formal Integrated Analyses, Meta-Analyses, and Bridging Analyses) Many clinical issues in an application can be addressed by an analysis considering data from more than one study. The results of such an analysis should generally be summarized in the clinical summary documents, but a detailed description and presentation of the results of such analyses are considered critical to their interpretation. Where the details of the analysis are too extensive to be reported in a summary document, they should be presented in a separate report. Such reports should be found in section 5.3.5.3. Examples of reports that would be placed in this section include (1) a report of a formal meta-analysis or extensive exploratory analysis of efficacy to determine an overall estimate of effect size in all patients and/or in specific subpopulations and (2) a report of an integrated analysis of safety that assesses such factors as the adequacy of the safety database, estimates of event rates, and safety with respect to variables such as dose, demographics, and concomitant medications. A report of a detailed analysis of bridging, considering formal bridging studies, other relevant clinical studies, and other appropriate information (e.g., PK and PD information), should be placed in this section if the analysis is too lengthy for inclusion in the Clinical Summary. 5.3.5.4 Other Study Reports This section can include: \u2022 Reports of interim analyses of studies pertinent to the claimed indications. \u2022 Reports of controlled safety studies not reported elsewhere. \u2022 Reports of controlled or uncontrolled studies not related to the claimed indication. \u2022 Published reports of clinical experiences with the medicinal product, which are not included in section 5.3.5.1.
